	<p> I graduated from Emory University in 2004, with a BA in Psychology.  I always associated psychology as a natru. In 2005 I was hired by <a href='http://www.pindotmedia.com' target="_blank"> PinDotMedia </a> as a Art Director, and stayed with the agency for 7 years.  Working primarily in print, it became  evident that  within our industry there was an ever increasing trend towards internet based marketing strategies. As a result of which, I decided it was time to "Sink or Swim" and study Web Design in Chicago at <a href='http://www.starterleague.com/' target="_blank"> The Starter League </a> located at <a href='http://www.1871.com/' target="_blank"> 1871 </a>.  Currently I am a developer at Shafer Condon Carter where I work with the following clients: Ad Council, Campbells, Cubs, ConAgra Foods, First Midwest Bank, Fusion Academy, Giordanos, Ideal Industries, Kerrygold, Pork Foodservice, Proctor & Gamble, Rich's Foodservice, Solo, Unlce Dougies, & Terlato Wines. </p>

Hobbies 

<h4 style="float:left; line-height:100%;">Photography  /<br>Illustration</h4>

<p class="clear-both"><strong>Photography</strong> - Having worked in the graphic design industry for so long, OCD image manipulation using Photoshop, became much of a pastime <em> {insert sarcasm} </em>. Eventually I decided that I should be creating photography rather than editing it. So thanks to the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, I immediately returned the money to the public and bought my first DSL Camera, the Nikon D40. </p>

<p> <strong>Illustration</strong> - My true hobby has always been illustration. In college I sold my first work of art <em> "The Ghetto of Athens"</em> &nbsp; to a philosophy professor at Emory University.  It was that masterpiece that ultimately set me on my path to being a Graphic Designer, Art Director, and now a Web Developer.</p>
