	<p> I graduated from Emory University in 2004, with a BA in Psychology.  I always thought psychology was a natural analoge to advertising in how it aims to alter behavior and perception. In 2005 I was hired by <a href='http://www.pindotmedia.com' target="_blank"> PinDotMedia </a> as a Art Director, and stayed with the agency for 7 years.  Working primarily in print, it became  evident that there was an ever increasing trend towards internet based marketing strategies. As a result of which, I decided it was time to "Sink or Swim" and study Web Development in Chicago at <a href='http://www.starterleague.com/' target="_blank"> The Starter League</a>.  Currently I am a developer at <a href ="http://www.schafercondoncarter.com/" target="_blank">Shafer Condon Carter</a> where I work with a variety clients, on projects ranging the full spectrum of digital needs.</p>

Hobbies 

<strong>Photography  /<br>Illustration</strong>

<p><strong>Photography</strong> - Having worked in the graphic design industry for so long, OCD image manipulation using Photoshop, became much of a pastime <em> {insert sarcasm} </em>. Eventually I decided that I should be creating photography rather than editing it. So thanks to the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, I immediately returned the money to the public and bought my first DSL Camera, the Nikon D40. </p>

<p> <strong>Illustration</strong> - My true hobby has always been illustration. In college I sold my first work of art <em> "The Ghetto of Athens"</em> &nbsp; to a philosophy professor at Emory University.  It was that masterpiece that ultimately set me on my path to being a Graphic Designer, Art Director, and now a Web Developer.</p>
