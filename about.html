		<p> I graduated from Emory University in 2004, with a BA in Psychology.  I always thought psychology was a natural analoge to advertising in how it aims to alter behavior and perception. In 2005 I was hired by <a href='http://www.pindotmedia.com' target="_blank" itemprop="url"> PinDotMedia </a> as a Art Director, and stayed with the agency for 7 years.  Working primarily in print, it became  evident that there was an ever increasing trend towards internet based marketing strategies. As a result of which, I decided it was time to "Sink or Swim" and study Web Development in Chicago at <a href='http://www.starterleague.com/' target="_blank" itemprop="url"> The Starter League</a>.  Currently I am a developer at <a href ="http://www.schafercondoncarter.com/" target="_blank" itemprop="url">Shafer Condon Carter</a> where I work with a variety clients, on projects ranging the full spectrum of digital needs.</p></div>

			<p>My first assignment at SCC was to rebuild their website, so yeah, I hit the ground running. Its a Rails / Backbone site with active admin CMS, and practically everything is content managed from the full-width background images to Vimeo embeds.  My next major assignment was the <a href="http://www.nathansfamous.com/" target="_blank" itemprop="url">Nathans Famous</a> website, that was also a Rails site with three static subdomains.  Nathan's build was consistent with the core tech stack practiced by the SCC Dev Team, Ruby CMS, Engines for interfacing with 3rd party data Social media, Jekyll for spinning up static Sub domains.</p>
			<p>My next major project was the <a href="http://www.porkfoodservice.org/" target="_blank" itemprop="url">Pork Foodservice</a> website which at the clients request was built in wordpress.  This was my first foray into PHP and Wordpress however we were able to achieve an equally robust CMS using the<a href ="http://magicfields.org/" target="_blank" itemprop="url"> Magic Fields </a> plugin.  Skip ahead a few pet projects (gardeneers.org / yallamedi.com ) and we Arrive at <a href="http://kerrygoldusa.com/" target="_blank" itemprop="url">Kerrygold</a>, which was a shining example of the SCC dev process:  Ruby CMS, polymorphic models, backbone views, solr site search.  Essentially we were tasked with taking a wordpress site, transitioning it to Rails and improving on CMS experience so that you could actually do more with less effort.</p>
			<p>After Kerrygold I worked on two Front End projects as the lead developer <a href="http://www.fusionacademy.com/" target="_blank" itemprop="url">Fusion Academy</a> and <a href="http://www.winonacapital.com/" target="_blank" itemprop="url">Winona Capital</a>.  The real challenge with Fusion was content, lots and lots of content, and organizing that content in a way thats best for User Experience.  Overall the client was very happy with the Front End that we came up with.  On Winona we had to come up with slick custom UI behaviors to bring life to otherwise dry content.

	<div class="expanded-content">
		 
		<p><strong>Photography</strong> - Having worked in the graphic design industry for so long, OCD image manipulation using Photoshop, became much of a pastime <em> {insert sarcasm} </em>. Eventually I decided that I should be creating photography rather than editing it. So thanks to the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, I immediately returned the money to the public and bought my first DSL Camera, the Nikon D40. </p>

		<p> <strong>Illustration</strong> - My true hobby has always been illustration. In college I sold my first work of art <em> "The Ghetto of Athens"</em> to a philosophy professor at Emory University.  It was that masterpiece that ultimately set me on my path to being a Graphic Designer, Art Director, and now a Web Developer.</p>
